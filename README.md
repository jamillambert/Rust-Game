## Car game written in Rust
This is a small game written in Rust as part of the course "Ultimate Rust 2: Intermediate Concepts" by Nathan Stocks [GitHub Page: ultimate_rust2](https://github.com/CleanCut/ultimate_rust2)

You control the car with the arrow keys or the w a s d keys.  You get a point for every blue barrel you hit, which also increases the car's speed.  **Avoid the other cars and the orange barrel!** if you hit any of those the game ends.
